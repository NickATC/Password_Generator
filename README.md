# Password Generator
*Version 1.0.   April 2018*

Here is a simple but very effective **Password Generator** built with a nice GUI for a better user experience.  By following 4 simple steps you can make (almost) unbreakable passwords.

You can create passwords from 8 characters up to 500.  Of course, with some editing to the main file, you can create up to 10000 or more characters.  

I'm working on a PASSWORD MANAGER so you can save the passwords on a database.  Keep an eye on the project [Password_Manager](https://github.com/NickATC/Password_Manager)

Since this is my first project, this will be a WIP.  Still learning a lot of things.
