# Password_Generator.  My first project as python developer.

Password generator is a small project intended to provide solution to creating more secure passwords where there are numbers, letters and symbols.

Password Manager will improve until it becomes a Password Manager.  This is where user can select the lenght of the password, as well as the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.  Then it will connect to a local database (SQLite?) where user can save, edit, modify, or delete passwords.  The main idea is to have access to the PassWord Manager and the user can access his/her webpages from there, and no need to remember every password.



Plans for different versions:  
*On version 0.1.  First release.  
User can only select the number of characters for the password.  

*On version 0.2   
GUI improved.  
Icon changed.  
User is able to copy the new password.


Since this is my first project, this will be a WIP.  Still learning a lot of things.
