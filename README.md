# Password Generator.  My first project as a python developer.

*Version 1.0.   April 2018*

Here is a simple but very effective **Password Generator** built with a nice GUI for a better user experience.
  

**Plans for different versions:**
~~On version 0.1.  First release.  
User can only select the number of characters for the password.  ~~

~~On version 0.2   --
-GUI improved.  
-Password creation algoritm improved.  User has more options.  
-Icon changed.  
-User is able to copy the new password.  
Bugs to kill:  
-When creating a new password, the previous one is not deleted from the GUI.  
-Error detection not working.  If user enters a letter instead of a number, program fails :(    

*Current version 1.0:  
-GUI improved.  The more Tkinter I learn, the more I try to improve for better and simpler user experience
-Menu added.
-User guide added.
-Tips to make more secure passwords was added.
-Copy to clipboard button added.
-Password creation algorith improved.
-The 2 main bugs were killed!  :
    -Error detection is working like a charm.  The program will only accept valid numbers.
    -If user wants to create another password, the previous one will be deleted first.

    
##To execute this program:  
1.  Download the repo.
2.  Run *password_generator.py*
3.  On the menu there is a user guide.  Just 4 steps to create more secure passwords
  
    
Since this is my first project, this will be a WIP.  Still learning a lot of things.
