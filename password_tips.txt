*******So, how to create more secure passwords:
*******************************
*******************************
	
5.  Longer passwords are better passwords. The more characters a password cracking program has to crunch, the harder it is to guess.
6.  Remove all the vowels from a short phrase in order to create a "word."
	Example: llctsrgry ("All cats are gray")
7.  Use an acronym: choose the first or second letter of your favorite quotation.
	Example: itsotfitd ("It's the size of the fight in the dog")
8.  Mix letters and non-letters in your passwords. (Non-letters include numbers and all punctuation characters on the keyboard.)
9.  Transform a phrase by using numbers or punctuation.
	Examples: Idh82go (I'd hate to go), UR1drful (you are wonderful).
10. Avoid choosing a password that spells a word. But, if you must, then:
11. Introduce "silent" characters into the word. Example: va7ni9lla
12. Deliberately misspell the word or phrase. Example: choklutt
13. Choose a word that is not composed of smaller words.
14. Add random capitalization to your passwords. Capitalize any but the first letter.
15. A random mix of alphabetical, numeric and symbolic characters.
	Example: eIeIoH!, o.U.Kid
16. Long word and number combinations. For example, take four words, and put some numbers between them: stiff3open92research12closer
17. An acronym for your favorite saying, or a song you like.
	Example: GykoR-66 (Get your kicks on Route 66) or L!isn! (Live! It's Saturday Night!).
18. An easily pronounced nonsense word with some non-letters inside.
	Example: slaRoo@Bey or klobinga-dezmin.
19. Change your password at least once a year. Better yet, change your password every few months to shrink your exposure window. You can make three or four passwords if you like, then switch them throughout the year.
20. Don't use the same password on multiple accounts. When one site is compromised, hackers try to use those passwords to access accounts on other sites. Don't let one break-in give hackers access to all your accounts.
